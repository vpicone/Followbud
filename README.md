Spotify's follow feature allows you to receive notifications when your favorite artists release new music. Followbud allows you to easily follow all of the artists in your favorite Spotify playlists.

After logging in through Spotify, you'll be presented with several of your playlists. Each playlist will tell you how many artists are inside and how many of them you are following. By click the button under each playlist, you'll follow all of the artists in it. Click the tools button to see some of the various things I used to build the site.

Best,
